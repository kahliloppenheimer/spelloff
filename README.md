## The Game
Spelloff is a game where players will compete to recombine the letters of a given word to spell as many other words as possible.

For example, the players might be given `Magazine` and solve for words like `game`, `gain`, `gem`, etc.

A player is rewarded points proportionally to how long the words they spell are.

Each round ends after 30 seconds. At the end of a round, a winner is announced and a new word is chosen.
